/* This problem asks us to fill N Queens in N * N ChessBoard such that no Queen will cancel each other
In order to be sure, no Queen cancel out each other, we need to check in 3 directions: 
a) In the column where we are placing the Queen
b) In the Top Right / Upper Right Diagonal of the Cell in which we are placing the Queen
c) In the Top Left  / Upper Left Diagonal of the  Cell in which we are placing the Queen
We don't need to check for the Rows, as each row will contain only a single Queen
Instead of using isSafe() function, which takes O(N) time to check if the Current Cell (i , j) is Safe or Not, we will use 3 vectors:
i)   col[n] --> Checks if we have already placed a Queen or not in the Same Column
ii)  topLeft[2 * n] -->  Checks if our Queen can be attacked by any Queen sitting in it's Top Left Diagonal / Upper Left Diagonal
iii) topRight[2 * n] --> Checks if our Queen can be attacked by any other Queen sitting in it's Top Right Diagonal / Upper Right Diagonal
To mark every index in our topLeft[] & topRight[] vectors, we use the following :
a) For any cell in our ChessBoard (i , j) to map it with corresponsing index in topLeft[], we use the formula: (i - j + n - 1)
b) For any cell in our ChessBoard (i , j) to map it with the corresponding index in topRight[], we use the formula(i + j)
