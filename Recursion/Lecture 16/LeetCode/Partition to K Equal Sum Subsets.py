"""
This question is based on reqSum Sum problem.   
We need to fill k buckets(using all the elements) of nums[]. Sum of each bucket should be same.
By doing a bit maths, we can easily calculate the reqSum of each bucket, which is, (totalSum / k)
we keep an array for sum of each partition and a boolean array to check whether an element 
is already taken into some partition or not.
