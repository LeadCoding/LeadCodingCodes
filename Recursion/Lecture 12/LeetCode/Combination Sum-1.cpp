/* The idea of this question is to return all such combinations whose individual sum is equal to Target
We use the same logic as generating Combinations - only difference is that we calculate the sum of each subset every time.
We can use an element as many times as we want
Our given vector arr[] contains only Unique Subsets that's for sure
